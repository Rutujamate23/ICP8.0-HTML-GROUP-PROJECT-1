<h3>10 Common Foods that are NOT Dog-friendli</h3>
<p>However, although these are common dangerous foods often found in households, it's not meant to be an all-inclusive list.The symptoms of poisoning vary depending on substance, the quantity a dog has consumed, the breed and size of the mammal. A common list of symptoms are digestion problems, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or blood in stool; bruising and bleeding gums, nose, or inside the ear canal; behavioral changes, such as lethargy, hyperactivity, and seizures; unusual items found in the dog's stool.If left in the vicinity, poisonous items can be swallowed by curious or hungry dogs. Uninformed pet owners have also been found to unintentionally poison their dogs by treating them with human medications or feeding them foods they can't metabolize.[1]

    In adittion, some plants are toxic to dogs. Poisoning by contact happens most commonly with indoor plants when a dog gets the substance on their coat or muzzle. These can cause skin irritation and burns, but they can also become ingested when grooming.[1]
    
    Inhaled toxins, such as smoke or pesticides, can find their way into a dog's respiratory system and cause difficult breathing. If left untreated, these toxins can make their way to other organs of the body.[2]</p>
