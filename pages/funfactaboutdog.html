    <p><h1> Fun Interesting Facts You May Not Know About Dogs</h1><br/>
        With dogs being domesticated animals, we often view them as part of our families with similar traits as humans. However, these four legged furry friends boast a number of different abilities and characteristics that make them a very unique type of species. Dogs used to be wild animals, and their history and biology sets them apart from us in many small ways, providing them with different strengths and abilities humans are incapable of. Here are several fun and interesting facts about dogs you may not already know.</p>

       <P>1]Dog’s nose prints are unique like fingerprints.  Just like with human fingerprints, a dog’s nose has its own unique pattern and can be used as a form of identification.<br/> 
2]Dog noses are wet because it allows them to smell better. The moisture helps absorb scent chemicals to then enable them to understand and identify what the smell. <br/>
3] All dogs dream but young and old dogs dream more than adult dogs. There is not enough studies done to determine exactly what dogs dream about. However, research shows that when sleeping, dogs do revisit activities and events that happened while they were awake. <br>


4] Yawning is contagious for dogs; even the sound of a human yawn, especially if their owner yawns, can trigger dogs to yawn. They don’t necessarily yawn because they are tired or have a buildup of CO2, but dogs yawn typically when feeling anxious or to empathize with those around them when they yawn. <br>


5] When sleeping, dogs curl up to protect their organs. This is most likely carried over from back when dogs were mostly in the wild, and needed to protect vital organs and keep warm when sleeping. <br>

6]  Surprisingly, dogs are not colorblind, but can actually see blue and yellow. They see the world in various combinations of blue and yellow, rather than black and white. <br>



7] After relieving themselves, dogs kick backwards not intentionally to cover it up, but rather to mark their territory using the scent glands in their feet. Additionally, it is believed that dogs spin around before going to the bathroom to align themselves with the Earth’s magnetic field, preferring to align with the north-south axis. </P>
