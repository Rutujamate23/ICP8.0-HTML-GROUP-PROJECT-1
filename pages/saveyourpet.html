    <h2> understand what your dogs need</h2>
    Contrary to popular belief, not all dogs can withstand cold weather conditions. Simply because they have a coat of fur does not mean they are adept to handling extreme temperatures. <br> Understand what your dog needs based on their breed, and learn what their tolerance is to the cold. Typically, double coated breeds or those with thicker undercoats are best suited for the outdoors. However, even if they may be a breed that is commonly able to withstand the cold, each and every dog may still have individual preferences as to how much cold they can handle.
    <h2>Set Up Proper Shelter</h2>
   <p>If you choose to allow your dog freedom to roam about outside in the elements, provide shelter with access to unfrozen water and food. In order for dogs to best handle the colder temperatures, they may need to eat more food to compensate due to their metabolisms working faster to keep warm.  <br>Consult your vet when considering changing their diet, and make necessary adjustments to ensure they are properly set up for success to endure the colder weather. Furthermore, depending on the weather conditions, water can freeze outside quicker than normal. Take extra measures to ensure your dog has plenty of unfrozen water to stay hydrated. <br>



Consider elevating the shelter or kennel you set up outside so that is it slightly higher than the ground. Moisture from the ground could build up which would take away heat, and render the shelter cold and futile in keeping your dog warm.</p>
